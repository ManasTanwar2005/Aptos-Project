Revenue Sharing Pools Smart Contract
Description
The Revenue Sharing Pools Smart Contract is a Move-based smart contract designed to facilitate the creation of decentralized revenue-sharing pools on the Aptos blockchain. It enables users to create revenue-sharing pools, contribute to these pools, and keep track of the total revenue and shares. This simple contract serves as a foundation for more complex revenue-sharing and crowdfunding mechanisms.

Vision
The vision behind this project is to provide a transparent and decentralized way for individuals and organizations to pool resources together and share in the revenue generated by their collective efforts. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project aims to ensure that revenue distribution is fair, secure, and fully auditable, enabling greater trust and collaboration between participants.

Future Scope
The future scope of the Revenue Sharing Pools includes:

Dynamic Share Distribution: Instead of equal shares, the contract can be extended to allow different users to receive different shares based on their contribution to the pool.

Automated Revenue Distribution: Once the pool reaches a certain revenue threshold, a mechanism for automatic distribution of funds can be implemented, allowing revenue to be shared with contributors based on their share.

Governance Features: Introduce governance mechanisms allowing pool members to vote on important decisions like the usage of funds or modifications to pool parameters.

Integration with Other Contracts: The contract can be extended to interact with other decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, enabling more complex use cases such as staking, investment funds, or profit-sharing.

User Interface: A user-friendly frontend for interacting with the contract would make it easier for non-technical users to create pools, contribute, and track their shares and revenues.

Contract Details
The Revenue Sharing Pools Smart Contract consists of two main functions:

1. create_pool(owner: &signer)
This function allows the creator (or "owner") of the pool to initialize a new revenue-sharing pool. Upon calling this function, a new pool is created with 0 shares and 0 revenue, and it is stored in the blockchain.

Parameters: The function takes the owner (signer) as an input, representing the individual or entity that owns the pool.

Returns: It doesn't return any value, but it stores the newly created pool in the blockchain.

2. contribute_to_pool(contributor: &signer, pool_owner: address, amount: u64)
This function enables a contributor to add funds to an existing pool. The contributor transfers a specified amount of Aptos coins to the pool owner, and the pool's total revenue and share count are updated.

Parameters:

contributor: The user who is contributing revenue to the pool.

pool_owner: The address of the pool owner who manages the pool.

amount: The amount of revenue (in Aptos coins) the contributor wishes to contribute.

Returns: The contract updates the pool's total revenue and share count.

Key Struct:
Pool: This struct represents the revenue-sharing pool and contains:

total_shares: The number of shares in the pool, which increases with every contribution.

total_revenue: The total amount of revenue in the pool.
